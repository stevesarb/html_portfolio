<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Top Gun</h3>
    <p>Radical fighter jet movie. Starring Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer.</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
    <p>Cool sci-fi movie. Arnold Shwarzenegger in his prime.</p>
<h3>Cars</h3>
    <p>My childhood staple. I've probably seen this movie more times 
        than anything else.
